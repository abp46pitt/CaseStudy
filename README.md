# Recumbent Bike Rental

Welcome to my case study! I made a recumbent bike rental service which allows users to browse all available bikes and make reservations. Rans recumbent bikes are hard to come by on the market and it is difficult to know whether one is worth the investment without trying one for yourself first. With this recumbent rental service, users will be able to rent cool and unique bikes to know if the hobby is right for them.
