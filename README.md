# CaseStudy

Welcome to my case study! I made a recumbent bike rental service which allows users to browse all available bikes and make reservations. There is also a system for logging in to view your account, past rentals, and other details. Finally, there is an admin page which allows for editing of bike details.

Backend was made using Java Spring Boot
Frontend uses HTML and JSP to generate dynamic pages

Tools used:
  - Eclipse
  - VS Code
  - MySQL Workbench
  - Spring Boot
  - Maven
  - JSP
